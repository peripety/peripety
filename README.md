👋 Hi, I'm mortified about being perceived and also desperately interested in meeting new people!

😰 Peri.  I mean I'm Peri.  I am vaguely they-shaped.

📉 Working on re-learning to code after my career got somewhat derailed by my company deciding I was more useful doing spreadsheets, which is also why this account isn't under my government name.  Expect a lot of what's here for awhile to be stupidly simple stuff.

👨‍💻 Focusing on JS at the moment and trying to make some decisions about what to throw in with that.  I'm interested in getting back into a lot more stuff with CI and testing, which my current job was not supporting even before I got derailed.

💬 I would love to chat if you're in a similar situation or just... honestly however you found this, email me at peri@peripety.dev or say hi to me on Mastodon at:
